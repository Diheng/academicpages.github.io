I am a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology, at the University of Arizona. Here is my professional information page. You can find almost all the academic information (and a little bit of personal information) about me here. If you did not find what you are looking for, please feel free to get in touch! You can find all the contact information on your left sidebar.

Research Interests:
======
As a researcher, I seek to understand the etiology of certain psychopathology (specifically, mood disorders) in the context of cognitive neuroscience and information theory, in hope of developing science-based, effective intervention. I aim to achieve this goal by two approaches: 

- Conducting in lab experiments to test existing hypothesis for etiology of psychopathology; 
- Creating computational models based on existing theories of how brain activities support normal cognitive/affective function, and to test 
the boundaries between normality and pathology with computational simulation. 

I am all about [open science]() and more and more [open source]().

In a much broader sense, I am also interested in research that explores the biological representation of memory and emotion in human beings and the possible corresponding mathematical representations for artificial intelligence.

Clinical Interests:
======
Since that it is still early on my clinical training, I am very open to all kinds of clinical practices. At this point, I am particularly interested in neuropsychology and forensics psychology training opportunities.

Outside of work!
======
I enjoy a wide variety of things: traveling (without aims), playing soccer, swimming, boxing, programming, math, reading, writing......
I am a tea and coffee snob - you don't see many of us anymore in this more and more polarized world.:-)
