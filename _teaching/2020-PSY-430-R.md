# Introduction
This post is meant to be a supplementary document for a course that I taught in 2020 Spring, _PSY 430 Advanced Psychological Measurement and Statistics_, which students are expected to learn R along the discussion of statistic, research methods and psychological measurement. In this document are lists of R materials that I found helpful for different areas of the application of R, and I hope it can help you if you want to start using R or go deeper in a specific area. I did not create the materials listed in this post. But rather, consider this post as a map that help you navigate the ocean of R materials out in the internet. 

# Basic info
If you are an absolute newbie and today is the first day of your R adventure, the official sites of [R-Project](https://www.r-project.org/) and the [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) are always good starts. Check out the _Resources_ page of the RStudio site. They have plenty of good stuffs to help you get familiar with the RStudio environment and start playing with R.

*Note:* Not too uncommonly that beginners confuse R with RStudio, specially if R is your first experience with programming. R is a general purpose computing language, so in fact you can use R for almost everything (not that I think that is reasonable to do so though). But RStudio is an Integrated development environment (IDE) which provide the tools that could help you use R more comfortably, at least as a beginner. So, please install R first and then the RStudio if you wish.

# Getting to know R (or programming in general)
To start with R, I recommend to go over as least the first 6 chapters of a book titles _[The Art of R Programming](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781593273842.do)_. This is definitely not the only R book out there but it is one of the best I read, especially comes to explaining the details of R language that matter for almost all kinds of data analysis or visualization you want to do down the road. It also provides the necessary programming background knowledge if you don't already have it and if you are one of those who want to know more about the tools that you use to be confident in your work. I also found that for most of the other books or courses online, they sometime assume you already know the background or at least have some other programming experience. The first 6 chapters of this book will probably give you enough information to understand most of the other materials and discussions online.

*Note:* I know that today not too many people still learn computer language by opening up a book in front of your computer, but I do struggle to find good, online, interactive materials for the fundamental knowledge of R. If you have some recommendation and are willing to share, please send me an email and I will update this post with proper credits. Thanks!

# R for (using and learning) statistic analysis

There are quite many high quality R visualizations and discussion forum for learning intro statistic for social science. Some institutes and great instructors are graciously offering their course online for free access. Below are two that I found the most systematic and gave me a lot of cool ideas about how to illustrate stat concept with clarity.

1. A group from the University of Oklahoma Political Science Department made their graduate methods course open source and freely available. Going through the materials step-by-step will be a great way to pick up basic R function and basic stat concept in the same time. All the materials will be applicable for the PSY 430 level and it is beautifully written, with embedded r code for analysis and visualization. Notice that it does not include contents like ANOVA and factorial analysis at the time of this post being written (April 2020).

2. Dr. Danielle Navarro at the University of New South Wales is working on a tutorial site for R for Psychological Science. Her tutorial in statistic is relatively more in depth, and her great project covers not just statistic, but also topics related to data science at broad. By the time of this post (April 2020) the site is still in progress but a lot of cool discussion on probability and introductory statistics are already available.

## Some cool visualization sites for learning statistics

1. [R<-Psychologist](rpsychologist.com)
Dr. Kristoffer Magnusson's RPsychologist.com is one of the most beautiful and interactive visualization collection you can find online. Don't just take my words. Check out the following cool visualization and see it yourself:

    [On Statisitcla Power and Significance Testing](https://rpsychologist.com/d3/NHST/)
    [On Correlations and Shared variance](https://rpsychologist.com/d3/correlation/)
    [On Maximum Likelihood](https://rpsychologist.com/d3/likelihood/)

A personal thank you is due and I really appreciate his work. It makes my class much more bearable and lot more productive.
