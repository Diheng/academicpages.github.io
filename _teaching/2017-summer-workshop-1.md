This was a five-sessions workshop delivered to the summer research assistants of the Program
of Anxiety, Cognition and Treatment Lab as part of their trainings. The
workshop covered basic R and Rstudio usage, important R packages like dplyr,
and basic concepts of data management and manipulation. RAs were asked to write
their own R script to clean and calculate the D score of an [Implicit
Association Test](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/education.html) study with the dataset from the [Project Implicit Mental Health](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/user/pimh/index.jsp)
study site as their final assignment.
